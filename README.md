## Tailwind CSS Setup

- **Config:** See [`tailwind.config.js`](./tailwind.config.js) for custom colors and animations.
- **Usage:** Tailwind is imported in [`src/index.css`](./src/index.css) with:
  ```css
  @import "tailwindcss";
  @config "../tailwind.config.js";
  ```

## Vite Configuration

- See [`vite.config.ts`](./vite.config.ts) for Vite and React plugin setup.

## Deployment Notes

- Ensure your deployment environment uses **Node.js v20+** for compatibility with Tailwind v4 and Lightning CSS ([Tailwind CSS compatibility docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/compatibility)).
- **If deploying to Netlify, you must explicitly select Node 20 in your Netlify site settings (Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Environment ‚Üí Node version).** Setting the Node version in environment variables or `package.json` alone is not sufficient.
